# BuyPlux Database Development: Helped BuyPlux Multiresources Limited develop a relational database that allows them to capture and store all of the key information and data generated by the business

### **Ask Phase: Asking Questions to Understand the Business Task** 
- **The Stakeholders**: Faith Emmanuel - CEO and the Executive Team.

- **The Business Question**: Build a relational database that will allow us to gather and store all of the critical information and data generated by the business so that we can monitor business performance in dashboards. Concentrate on the backend; we'll engage someone else to create the front-end ordering mechanism. 


### **Development Phase: Developing the Relational Database** 
- SQL Data Definition Language(DDL) was used to developed the database schema.
- Microsoft SQL Server was used as the database engine.
- QuickDB was used to develop the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
